# PlainSight
 
This is a project of mine that deals with encrypting of data, in a fairly unique way. Given any image and any file, it will create a new image that looks nearly identical to the original, with the file's data hidden inside of the pixels. The way in which I've done this is through a "MegaPixel", as well as monitoring offsets of each pixel's RGB values.

This is a project that I initially had my friends and I develop in 2017 for a programming hackathon (UI and all), as it seemed like a really cool idea. Since then, we redesigned it a year later at another hackathon to improve upon its failures and file limitations.

This solo project is a continuation of that idea, but with overall improvements to the actual encryption: decreasing file sizes with compression, improving performance significantly through better algorithms, and (potentially, but not yet in the works) an upscaling option for the image to look as unmodified and inconspicuous as possible.

Keep in mind that as of writing this, the decryptor has not yet been finished, or touched for that matter. Tl;dr work and school keep me busy, so I'm taking my sweet time.
